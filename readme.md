## Cliqz Autoconsent

This is a library of rules for navigating through common consent popups on the web. These rules
can be run in a Firefox webextension, or in a puppeteer orchestrated headless browser. Using
these rules, opt-in and opt-out options can be selected automatically, without requiring
user-input.

This library is primarily used by the [re:consent](https://github.com/cliqz-oss/re-consent)
browser extension in order to automate user-consent, and make a cleaner browsing experience.
